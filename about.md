Hi! My name is Limuel. I like **coffee, music, games and technology**. I'm currently a **Lead Software Quality Assurance Engineer** based here in the **Philippines** and I'm very passionate about **DevOps, Automation, Software Testing and Web Development**.

Hopefully I could write a lot of content that could help both Software Engineers and Quality Assurance Engineers around the world to be more productive!
